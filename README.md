##TutorMap – Mobile Crowd-Sensing App for Finding and Rating Private Tutors

A Kotlin-based mobile application built with Jetpack Compose that helps users discover nearby private tutors and small educational centers.
Using real-time location tracking and Firebase synchronization, the app displays all registered tutors on an interactive map, along with their attributes such as subject, rating, and description.

Users can add new tutors at their current location, rate existing ones, leave comments, and browse detailed information. 
Each interaction rewards points, contributing to a public leaderboard visible to all users. 
The app also supports filtering and searching tutors by subject, author, attributes, or radius from the user’s current position.

This project demonstrates mobile crowd sensing, user-generated geospatial content, real-time database synchronization, and modern Android development using Jetpack Compose and Firebase.
